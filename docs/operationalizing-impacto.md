## Step 1: Understand and Leverage the IMPACTO Model

Begin by reviewing the [**IMPACTO Model Repository**](https://github.com/kylevillano/IMPACTO-Model), which provides detailed documentation, schemas, examples, and FAQs.

Key documents include:

- **Core Documentation:** `IMPACTO Model_v0_1.docx`
- **Example Use Case:** `IMPACTO Example Use Case_v_0_1.docx`
- **Overview:** `IMPACTO Model At a Glance_v0_1.docx`
- **FAQs:** `IMPACTO Model FAQs_v0_1.docx`

These resources provide the foundation needed to apply the model effectively.

## Step 2: Customize and Operationalize with IMPACTO Assistant GPT

Utilize the **IMPACTO Assistant GPT** to:

- Develop a customized **Maturity Classification Framework (MCF)** tailored specifically to your organization's maturity across business, people, and process dimensions.
- Build a tailored **Capability Classification Framework (CCF)** aligning your cybersecurity capabilities with MITRE ATT&CK.
- Conduct **Purchased Stage Assessments**, clearly identifying planned versus actual capabilities and operational contexts.
- Interactively walkthrough each stage of the IMPACTO Model for clarity and practical guidance.
- Create a comprehensive cybersecurity roadmap tailored to your maturity and capability goals.

## Step 3: Visualize and Execute Roadmap with Gantt Chart GPT

After using IMPACTO Assistant GPT to define your strategic roadmap, move seamlessly to the **Gantt Chart GPT** to:

- Transform your strategic roadmap into an intuitive, interactive Gantt Chart.
- Clearly visualize milestones, timelines, dependencies, and project phases.
- Generate an easily shareable link to facilitate collaboration and tracking.

This step significantly improves execution planning, progress monitoring, and stakeholder communication.
